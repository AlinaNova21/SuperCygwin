SuperCygwin
===========
SuperCygwin is a tabbed interface for MinTTY (Cygwin). 
It was inspired by SuperPutty but has been re-wrote for use with Cygwin's MinTTY.
The program currently expects cygwin to be in C:\cygwin. Adding support for alternate locations is planned for a future build.

Compiling:
The project requires .net framework 4 and the previous versions to to meet all program and library requirements.
Standard Compilation is to open the Project in the Visual Studio (2008+) and compile the program as required.
Please note you will have to compile the program twice as the github repo does not contain the auto upload script that is
located on our PCs to automate uploads to ags131.co

Running:
Running the program is simple, open the main executable, and click the + button in the preset window.
Enter a name for the preset, and enter the location of MinTTY (Default is standard Cygwin Install location).
Save the preset with the save button in the tool bar, and open the preset from the dock bar at the side.


TODO: Convince someone to write a better readme! This is NOT my forte!
